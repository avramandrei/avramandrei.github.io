I am the lead machine learning engineer at the medical AI startup [Diktatura](https://diktatura.com/) and a research 
assistant at the [Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence "Mihai Drăgănescu" (RACAI)](https://www.racai.ro/en/). I am
interested in various areas from natural language processing, speech processing and machine learning in general, tackling
problems like information extraction, automatic speech recognition, document classification or punctuation restoration. 

One of my main focus areas in the past (and still is to a certain degree) has been the development of resources for the Romanian 
language (my native langauge). Some of my contributions include:
- The development of the Romanian BERT. \[[pdf](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.387/)\] \[[code](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/Romanian-Transformers)\]
- The development of several distilled Romanian BERT models. \[[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12650)\] \[[code](https://github.com/racai-ai/Romanian-DistilBERT)\]
- The creation of the Romanian Named Entity Corpus (RONEC) and the integration of a model, trained on this dataset, into spaCy. \[[pdf](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.546/)\] \[[code](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/ronec)\]
- The development of a Romanian speech recognition based on DeepSpeech2. \[[pdf](https://academiaromana.ro/sectii2002/proceedings/doc2020-4/11-Avram_Tufis.pdf)\] \[[code](https://github.com/racai-ai/RobinASR)\]
- Collaborating in the creation of LiRo - a leaderboard for Romanian langauge tasks. \[[pdf](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JH61CD7afTv)\] \[[website](https://lirobenchmark.github.io/)\]
